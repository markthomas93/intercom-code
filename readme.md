You can install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/idkppmfdnbebeikaplhpckbmbfbeedon/publish-accepted?authUser=2&hl=en-US), or you can build it from source.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Building the extension

```
npm run build
```

After running this command, a `dist` folder should be generated that you can use by going to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser and then clicking `Load Unpacked` and selecting the generated `dist` folder.
